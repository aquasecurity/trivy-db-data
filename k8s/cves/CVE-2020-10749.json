	"description": "CVSS Rating: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L (6.0 Medium)A cluster configured to use an affected container networking implementation is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. By sending “rogue” router advertisements, a malicious container can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker-controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.Am I vulnerable?Kubernetes itself is not vulnerable. A Kubernetes cluster using an affected networking implementation is vulnerable.Binary releases of the kubelet installed from upstream Kubernetes Community repositories hosted at https://packages.cloud.google.com/ may have also installed the kubernetes-cni package containing the containernetworking CNI plugins, which are affected by CVE-2020-10749.",
