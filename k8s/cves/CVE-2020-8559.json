	"description": "CVSS Rating: Medium (6.4) CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:HIf an attacker is able to intercept certain requests to the Kubelet, they can send a redirect response that may be followed by a client using the credentials from the original request. This can lead to compromise of other nodes.If multiple clusters share the same certificate authority trusted by the client, and the same authentication credentials, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to redirect the client to another cluster. In this configuration, this vulnerability should be considered High severity.Am I vulnerable?You are only affected by this vulnerability if you treat the node as a security boundary, or if clusters share certificate authorities and authentication credentials.Note that this vulnerability requires an attacker to first compromise a node through separate means.",
