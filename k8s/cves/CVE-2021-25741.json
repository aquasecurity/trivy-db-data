	"description": "A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user may be able to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files \u0026 directories outside of the volume, including on the host filesystem.This issue has been rated High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), and assigned CVE-2021-25741.Affected Components and ConfigurationsThis bug affects kubelet.Environments where cluster administrators have restricted the ability to create hostPath mounts are the most seriously affected. Exploitation allows hostPath-like access without use of the hostPath feature, thus bypassing the restriction.In a default Kubernetes environment, exploitation could be used to obscure misuse of already-granted privileges.",
