Only Kubernetes 1.5.0-1.5.4 installations that do all of the following:kubeadm and GKE do not allow enabling PodSecurityPolicy in 1.5, so are not affected by this vulnerability.kube-up.sh and kops do not enable PodSecurityPolicy by default, so are not affected by this vulnerability.

A user that is authorized to create pods can make use of any existing PodSecurityPolicy, even ones they are not authorized to use.How can I mitigate this prior to installing 1.5.5?",
