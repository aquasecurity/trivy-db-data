If a pod writes a large amount of data to the /etc/hosts file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.Am I vulnerable?Any clusters allowing pods with sufficient privileges to write to their own /etc/hosts files are affected. This includes containers running with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE in their capabilities bounding set (true by default) and either UID 0 (root) or a security context with allowPrivilegeEscalation: true (true by default).",
