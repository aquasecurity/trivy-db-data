	"description": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:LThe API server mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced. Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges).Vulnerable versions: Kubernetes 1.7.x-1.12.xKubernetes 1.13.0-1.13.8Kubernetes 1.14.0-1.14.4Kubernetes 1.15.0-1.15.1Vulnerable configurations: All clusters that have rolebindings to roles and clusterroles that include authorization rules for cluster-scoped custom resources.Vulnerability impact: A user with access to custom resources in a single namespace can access custom resources with cluster scope.Mitigations prior to upgrading: To mitigate, remove authorization rules that grant access to cluster-scoped resources within namespaces. For example, RBAC roles and clusterroles intended to be referenced by namespaced rolebindings should not grant access to resources:[*], apiGroups:[*], or grant access to cluster-scoped custom resources.",
