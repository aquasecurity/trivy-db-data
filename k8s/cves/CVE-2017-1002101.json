	"description": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:HThis vulnerability allows containers using subpath volume mounts with any volume type (including non-privileged pods, subject to file permissions) to access files/directories outside of the volume, including the host’s filesystem.Thanks to Maxim Ivanov for reporting this problem.Vulnerable versions:Vulnerable configurations:Vulnerability impact: A specially crafted pod spec combined with malicious container behavior can allow read/write access to arbitrary files outside volumes specified in the pod, including the host’s filesystem. This can be accomplished with any volume type, including emptyDir, and can be accomplished with a non-privileged pod (subject to file permissions).Mitigations prior to upgrading: Prevent untrusted users from creating pods (and pod-creating objects like deployments, replicasets, etc), or disable all volume types with PodSecurityPolicy (note that this prevents use of service account tokens in pods, and requires use of  automountServiceAccountToken: false)",
